# setState() Called After Dispose Fix

## Problem Description

The error `setState() called after dispose()` occurs when:
- A user logs in and navigates away from the HomeScreen
- Async operations (like API calls) are still running in the background
- These operations try to call `setState()` after the widget has been disposed
- This causes a runtime error and potential memory leaks

## Root Cause

The issue happens because:
1. User logs in and HomeScreen starts loading data
2. User navigates to another screen (HomeScreen gets disposed)
3. Background API calls complete and try to update the UI
4. `setState()` is called on a disposed widget

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Mounted Checks

Before every `setState()` call in async methods, we now check if the widget is still mounted:

```dart
// Check if widget is still mounted before setting state
if (!mounted) return;
setState(() { 
  // state updates 
});
```

### 2. Updated Methods in HomeScreen

- `_fetchStatusOverviewData()` - Added mounted checks before each setState
- `_fetchActivityLogs()` - Added mounted checks before each setState  
- `_loadUserRole()` - Added mounted check before setState
- Expansion tile callback - Added mounted check

### 3. Updated Methods in JobStep

- `_loadUserRoleAndInitializeSteps()` - Added mounted checks before each setState

### 4. Updated Methods in WorkScreen

- `_initializePage()` - Added mounted check before setState
- `_fetchAllJobPlannings()` - Added mounted checks before each setState
- `_filterJobs()` - Added mounted check before setState

### 5. Updated Methods in NotificationsScreen

- `_loadUserRoleAndNotifications()` - Added mounted checks before each setState
- `_loadNotifications()` - Added mounted checks before each setState

### 6. Added Dispose Methods

All screens now have proper dispose methods that:
- Cancel ongoing operations
- Prevent memory leaks
- Clean up resources

## Code Example

```dart
Future<void> _fetchStatusOverviewData() async {
  if (_jobApi == null) return;
  
  // Check if widget is still mounted before setting state
  if (!mounted) return;
  setState(() { isLoadingStatus = true; });
  
  try {
    final data = await _jobApi!.getData();
    
    // Check if widget is still mounted before updating state
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() { 
      // update state with data 
    });
  } catch (e) {
    // Check if widget is still mounted before setting error state
    if (!mounted) return;
    setState(() { 
      // set error state 
    });
  }
  
  // Check if widget is still mounted before final setState
  if (!mounted) return;
  setState(() { isLoadingStatus = false; });
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Runtime Errors**: No more setState after dispose errors
2. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup of resources
3. **Better User Experience**: No crashes when navigating quickly
4. **Maintains Functionality**: All features still work as expected

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Login to the app
2. Quickly navigate away from HomeScreen before data loads
3. Verify no setState errors in console
4. Verify app continues to work normally

## Best Practices

1. Always check `mounted` before `setState()` in async methods
2. Cancel ongoing operations in `dispose()`
3. Use proper error handling with mounted checks
4. Consider using `StreamSubscription` for cancellable operations
